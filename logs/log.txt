* getting to know the data

* submitted the naive prediction of a 50-50 chance for both teams. The log-
loss of this prediction is 0.6931472. I will refer to this as the naive 
baseline log-loss.

* As a first step beyond the naive 50-50 prediction, I computed the overall 
historical percentage in which the favored (i.e. lower seeded team) wins. This 
probability is 70.15%. I applied this probability to the 2014-2017 test sample. 
The Log-loss fell to 0.6064068.

* added win-loss record as features. Tried an initial logistic regression.
Submitted. The Log-loss fell to 0.58261 on my machine, .561579 on  Kaggle's 
leader board.

PREDICTIONS
1. seed_win_prediction.csv
Prediction is historical average frequency of favored team winning
The Log-loss fell to 0.6064068.

2. record_win_prediction.csv
Predictions using a logistic regression model of win-loss record.
Logistic regression. Includes, for both teams 1 and 2, win percentage, number 
of  wins, number of games played, as well as an indicator variable for whether 
or not team 1 was seeded lower (i.e. team 1 was favored).
Log-loss fell to 0.58261.
